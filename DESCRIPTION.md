## About
A Shaderpack focused on enhancing vanilla.
Uses a stylized lighting model that blends vanilla lighting with dynamic shadows.

This pack is still in development, I will most likely rewrite most features in it, and add more.
It currently has no Options, Weather or Clouds, and the nether and end are not tested.


## Features
- A Stylised lighting model that improves vanilla without changing too much.
- Pixel Perfect PBR Lighting and Dynamic Shadows.
- Improved Water shaders.


## Why
Most Shaderspacks exist on a spectrum, from Vanilla+ packs that don't do enough, to ones that are impractical for gameplay.
As packs add more features and effects, they tend to focus on things that diverge too much from the base game.
LBR Enhanced has the goal of being a middle-ground pack focused 


## Screenshots
I used some extra mods while making the pack, screenshots contain some modded blocks and things.
- Alpine Highlands, Maple Woodlands, and Sugi Forest biomes from Nature's Spirit.
- The structures are made from Create blocks.
- Bedrock Waters changes water colors, I have disabled both settings on it's configuration menu.
- PBR Textures are from Embrace Pixels and Create LAB PBR.


## Planned Features
- Options
- FXAA and Texture Filtering
- Emmision and HDR
- Bloom (And other PostFX)
- Distant Horizons Support (Also Distant Fog)
- Mod Support and Compatibility
